"The art of data science is turning data into insights that inform action. The magic is in making those insights accessible and understandable to everyone."

As a masterâ€™s student in Data Science at Pace University, I combine my passion for data analysis with a strong foundation in business and marketing. This unique blend fuels my drive to uncover valuable insights from data and translate them into impactful business decisions. My diverse background includes leading an AI/ML initiative to extract consumer insights from visual data, collaborating on a customer lifetime value model that boosted retention by 20%, and designing efficient data pipelines. This hands-on experience, coupled with my academic knowledge, allows me to bridge the gap between technical solutions and real-world business needs. Beyond being an enthusiastic learner and engaging storyteller, I'm an independent thinker who thrives on challenging the status quo. I break traditions, learn from mistakes, and constantly strive to improve and contribute. My relentless work ethic and dedication to acquiring knowledge, regardless of the source, make me a valuable asset for any data-driven team.

I'm eager to leverage my skills and passion to make a real impact in the field of data science. I welcome opportunities to discuss how I can contribute to your team's success!
